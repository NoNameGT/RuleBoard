Dont be rude,
Dont Cheat/Mod,
Be respectful to everyone,
Dont impersonate,
Dont do glitches,
Dont spam messages,
Dont ruin everyone's fun,
Dont use a VPN because the delay would ruin upcoming gamemodes,
You also have to be active in the server (not obviously all the time but when you can) to keep your mod / stuff. if your not active you will get it taken away. if you go active again after being inactive for too long i might give it back,

And just enjoy the game!
